# CSS Keyframe animation 

## What does it do?
###### CSS keyframes help customise animations by setting the appropriate value for it properties.

## Projects purpose:
###### To demonstrate css keyframe animation capability.

## Technologies utilised:
###### HTML5 and CSS3.

## Description of the task completed in this demonstration:
* The keyframe name is jump.
* The animation cycle is infinite. 
* The goal is to make this ball jump up and down. 
* The ball goes from 0px to 100px on the y-axis.
* One animation cycle takes half of the second to complete. 
* Where traditionally animations are set to 'ease', meaning the animation starts slowly, speeds up in the middle and then finishes slowly. 
* It did not appear smooth on first impressions, so the Bezier curve has been implimented to improve the animation timing of a ball bouncing.
* Enjoy!
